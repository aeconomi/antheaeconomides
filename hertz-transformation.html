                           <p class="is-size-5">In order to keep up with technology, expectations, and competition in the
                              marketplace,
                              the Hertz.com Digital Transformation endeavored to unify the disconnected legacy
                              platforms and redesign the Hertz digital experience. The project used an agile release
                              process
                              to deploy different sections of the website in order to launch more quickly and facilitate
                              customer feedback/customer-focused development. As one of the Content Leads, my role was to
                              help migrate the 2,000+ pages (not including translations) onto an up-to-date CMS platform,
                              ensuring the content was brand approved and SEO optimized. A project of this scale required
                              input from many different departments. I collaborated with the IBM development,
                              UX, and Marketing teams on a day-to-day basis.

                              During the planning phase, I helped reorganize, rewrite, and
                              restructure the content moving from the old site to the new site. <span class="marker">
                              One of my responsibilities was to log and keep track of the pages that would be migrated,

                           <p class="is-size-5">
                              Over the years, the legacy website had racked up a huge number of pages,
                              many of which were old and outdated with irrelevant content.
                              In order to keep track of all the pages, we used Gather Content to organize
                              sections of the site into different “buckets”, (e.g. Location,
                              Special Offer, Marketing Landing Pages). Google Analytics was a good starting
                              point to know which pages to include in the migration:
                           </p>
                           <br>
                           <ul class="bullets is-size-5">
                              <li>Pages with high amounts of
                                 traffic were automatically included in the migration because they were either valuable to
                                 our customers or valuable to our marketing efforts.
                              </li>
                              <li>Evergreen pages (content that is always relevant) or pages the company deemed essential
                                 (like FAQs, Partner pages, or pages required by Legal) were also important.
                              </li>
                              <li>Pages with high bounce rates were reviewed for content restructuring and rewrites to be
                                 done by our SEO agency.
                              </li>
                              <li>Pages with low amounts of traffic were reviewed for 301 redirects.</li>

                              We then went through each of
                              the buckets with the appropriate stakeholders and our SEO agency to see which ones we needed
                              to keep, restructure, and remove. We also reviewed the content to determine if it was still
                              relevant and whether or not
                              the content still matched the voice of the brand.

                              While we knew we had a lot of customers that rented
                              for business travel, the company also did a brand positioning workshop to help identify
                              high-growth target

                                    for all three brands.
                                    The developers would reutilize the code base and develop a a common core library, a

                           I really enjoyed being a part of each stage in the website migration and redesign- to be
                           involved on the content side of developing
                           and launching new features, gathering feedback, then making changes based on our findings.
                           More often, the small changes had the biggest impact. Removing unnecessary steps
                           and content from the checkout process was a primary driver in increased conversion rates.

                           The project was very challenging, one of which was the sheer amount of
                           people involved. People were constantly rolling on and off the project so it was tough
                           keeping everyone on the same page. Another
                           difficulty was communicating with remote teams in different time zones. Slack made
                           back-and-forth updates more fluid but I also found recording meetings and training
                           sessions helpful. Our daily standups also kept team members aligned during each
                           stage of the project and ensured there was no overlap in responsibilities.
