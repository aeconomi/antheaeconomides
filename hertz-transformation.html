                           <p class="is-size-5">In order to keep up with technology, expectations, and competition in the marketplace,
                              the Hertz.com Digital Transformation aimed to unify the disconnected legacy 
                              platforms and redesign the Hertz digital experience. The project used an agile release process 
                              to deploy different sections of the website in order to launch more quickly and facilitate 
                              customer feedback/customer-focused development. As one of the Content Leads, my role was to 
                              help migrate the 2,000+ pages (not including translations) onto an up-to-date CMS platform, 
                              ensuring the content was brand approved and SEO optimized. This was a huge project and required 
                              input from many different departments, but I typically collaborated with the IBM development, 
                              UX, and Marketing teams on a day-to-day basis.

                        During the planning phase, I helped re-organize, re-write, and 
                        re-structure the content moving from the old site to the new site. 
                        One of my responsibilities was to log and keep track of the pages that would be migrated, 
                        301 redirected, and rewritten for SEO optimization.
                     </p>

                     <p class="is-size-5">
                        Over the years, the legacy website had racked up a huge number of pages, 
                        many of which were old and outdated with irrelevant content. 
                        In order to keep track of all the pages, we used Gather Content to organize the
                        different sections of the site into different “buckets”, (e.g. Location, 
                        Special Offer, Marketing Landing Pages).  Google Analytics was a good starting 
                        point to know which pages to include in the migration. Pages with high amounts of 
                        traffic were valuable in addition to evergreen pages or pages the company deemed essential. 
                        Pages with high bounce rates were reviewed for content restructuring and rewrites, and pages
                        with low amounts of traffic were reviewed for 301 redirects. We also went through each of 
                        the buckets with the appropriate stakeholders and our SEO agency to see which ones we needed 
                        to keep, restructure, and get rid of. We reviewed how old the page was, if the content was 
                        still relevant, and if the content still matched the voice of the brand. 
                     </p>

                        While we knew we had a lot of customers that rented 
                        for business travel, the company also did a brand positioning workshop to help identify high-growth target 
                        prospects and customer personas.
                        Our three high growth targets were identified as:

                        It was important for our team not only to position existing content to align with these 
                        persona’s needs, but also develop new content ideas and assets that would help catch their 
                        attention and move them closer to renting a vehicle. As a few actions from these findings, we gave our young driver page a content
                        refresh, optimized for SEO, and added banners on the homepage targeted towards young drivers
                        .

                        into the new CMS platform. Since the reservation flow was the first section of the new site that would be released
                        to customers on the Beta site,
                        we prioritized loading content that would show in the reservation flow.

                        The website was being migrated to page templates on a new version of AEM, which allowed for increased scalability
                        and contsistency throughout the site. While the first phase was focused on
                        migrating the Hertz website, the plan was to reutilize the code base and develop a list of 
                        features called a common core library that could be used for the Dollar and Thrifty website 
                        redesigns as well. This meant a lot of the generic content could be 
                        reused for all three brands, giving us a leg up on the transformations for the other Brands while reducing 
                        development costs.

                        We planned to roll out the website to different regions and dialects in an iterative fashion. 
                        With hertz.com serving customers in over 150 countries, each source market would have
                        content provided in English (US English or UK English) and many would have their region’s local 
                        dialect as well. In total, we had to plan and prep content to support 32 different dialects.

                     and target different customer segments using banners from DoubleClick for a more personalized feel. But the 
                     old layout felt too condensed, like a big block of advertisements.

                     The new Beta reservation flow was modeled after the new Brand Guidelines, 
                     which supported design systems that were light and airy with pops of yellow for brand reinforcement. 
                     The vehicle selection page gave the car images more room
                     and an opportunity to emphasize prestige and high-end vehicles. Unecessary text and 
                     legal jargon was removed from the ancillary and checkout pages, giving these pages a 
                     clean and less overwhelming appearance.

                        conversions were identified, we had processes in place that allowed us to pivot quickly to fix issues. In sessions using Clicktale, our analytics team found that one of the biggest

                        each menu title for simplicity and added search, chat, and contact information in the header

                              The new reservation flow rolled out to US and Canadian customers in early March, 
                              right around when covid-19 shutdowns began. The virus took a direct hit on the travel 
                              industry so it was hard to measure the impact the redesign had on conversions and
                              eCommerce revenue. However, we were able to measure the impact on page load speed
                              right away. Page load times dropped from 6 seconds to 3-4 seconds- almost a 50% decrease!
                              Code refactoring played a role in this but also reducing file sizes and compressing images.

                              I learned so much from working on this project and all the logistics that go into a
                              website migration and redesign. It was interesting to be a part of each stage- to develop
                              and launch new features, conduct testing, then make changes based on our findings. 
                              Most often, the small differences had the biggest impact. Removing unnecessary steps
                              and popups from the checkout process was a primary driver in increased conversion rates.

                              One big learning was that creating consistent page templates and a single design system
                              is vital for a unified brand experience but it's also important to build templates and
                              components that allow for as much flexibility as possible as priorities and marketing 
                              initiatives change over time.

                              The project had many challenges, but one big difficulty stemmed from the sheer amount of
                              people  involved. People were constantly rolling on and off the project so it was tough 
                              keeping everyone on the same page. Another
                              difficulty was communicating with remote teams in different time zones. Slack made
                              back-and-forth updates more fluid but I also found recording meetings and training
                              sessions helpful. Our daily standups also kept team members aligned during each 
                              stage of the project and ensured there was no overlap in responsibilities.
