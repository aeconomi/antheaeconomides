                          <p class="is-size-5">In order to keep up with technology, expectations, and competition in the marketplace,
                              the Hertz.com Digital Transformation project aimed to unify the disconnected legacy 
                              platforms and redesign the Hertz digital experience. The project used an agile release process 
                              to deploy different sections of the website in order to launch more quickly and facilitate 
                              customer feedback/customer-focused development. As part of the content team, my role was to 
                              help migrate the 2,000+ pages (not including translations) onto an up-to-date CMS platform, 
                              ensuring the content was brand approved and SEO optimized. This was a huge project and required 
                              input from many different departments, but I personally collaborated with the IBM development, 
                              UX, and Marketing teams on a day-to-day basis.

                              To stay on top of tight timelines, we loaded “base” content (content that 
                              we took from the legacy site that could be used as a starting point for the new site) 
                              into the new CMS platform. We prioritized this content according to the release schedule
                              and loaded the booking process first since the reservation flow was the first section to 
                              be released.

                              and to make sure the end solution met business requirements. We regularly reported up to
                              the Product Owners to make sure we were on track and targets were met for each sprint. 
                              We worked in weekly iterations with the PO’s regularly re-prioritizing the backlog to focus

                            The website was being migrated to a new version of AEM, which allowed for increased scalability
                             and control over the content. The new CMS also had page templates that were a part of the design
                              refresh and allowed for more consistency across the site. While the first phase was focused on
                               migrating the Hertz website, the plan was to reutilize the code base and develop a list of 
                               features called a common core library that could be used for the Dollar and Thrifty website 
                               redesigns as well. This meant a lot of the generic content used on rental car websites could be 
                               reused for all three brands, giving us a leg up on the other transformations and reducing 
                               development costs.

                            We planned to roll out the website to different regions and dialects in an iterative fashion 
                            as well. With hertz.com serving customers in over 150 countries, each source market would have
                             content provided in English (US English or UK English) and many would have their region’s local 
                             dialect as well. In total, we had to plan and prep content to support 32 different dialects.

                        Working in iterative development cycles, we used A/B testing and user feedback to make
                         content updates and inform development as sections were released.  Design blockers to 
                         conversions were identified, enabling us to fix them and watch conversion analytics to 
                         confirm issues were resolving. In sessions using Clicktale, we found that one of the biggest 
                         pain-points for customers was site structure and search functionality. We ended up shortening
                          each menu title for simplicity and added search, chat, and contact information in the header 
                          to make it easier for customers to find what they were looking for.

                        The new reservation flow rolled out to US and Canadian customers in early March, 
                        right around when covid-19 shutdowns began. The virus took a direct hit on the travel 
                        industry so it was hard to measure the impact the redesign had on conversions and
                         eCommerce revenue. However, we were able to measure the impact on page load speed
                          right away. Page load times dropped from 6 seconds to 3-4 seconds- almost a 50% decrease!
                           Code refactoring played a role in this but also reducing file sizes and compressing images. 
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="is-size-5">
                        I learned so much from working on this project and all the logistics that go into a
                         website migration and redesign. It was interesting to be a part of each stage- to develop
                          and launch new features, conduct testing, then make changes based on our findings. 
                          Most often, the small differences had the biggest impact. Removing unnecessary steps
                           and popups from the checkout process was a primary driver in increased conversion rates. 
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="is-size-5">
                        One big learning was that creating consistent page templates and a single design system
                         is vital for a unified brand experience but it's also important to build templates and
                          components that allow for as much flexibility as possible as priorities and marketing 
                          initiatives change over time. 
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="is-size-5">
                        The project had many challenges, but one big difficulty stemmed from the sheer amount of
                         people  involved. People were constantly rolling on and off the project so it was tough 
                         keeping everyone on the same page.  We also ended up changing vendors midway, so knowledge
                          transfer sessions and documentation throughout the process was extremely important. Another
                           difficulty was communicating with remote teams in different time zones. Slack made
                            back-and-forth updates more fluid but I also found recording meetings and training
                             sessions helpful. Our daily standups also kept team members aligned during each 
                             stage of the project and ensured there was no overlap in responsibilities.
