                        <p class="is-size-5">The old Hertz app was outdated, crashed frequently, and required
                           development in order to update content. In partnering with IBM, our team worked
                           with the Marketing, UX, and Creative Services teams to deliver the new Hertz Mobile App.
                           The new Hertz app gives customers a faster rental experience, allowing users to
                           login with touch ID, manage their rewards, and find nearby locations in an updated user
                           interface. My role was to help provide the content and design templates
                           that could be used to collaborate with the brand and development teams. I also played a role
                           in marketing the launch of the app by building landing pages and posting banners and
                           videos on the website to help drive awareness.

                     Giving our customers better speed
                     and convenience during their rental journey was a primary focus for the new app. One of the biggest
                     problems customers had with the old app was that it either froze,
                     crashed, or was slow to load.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p class="is-size-5">
                     Some of the top uses of the old Hertz app was to:
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <ol class="bullets is-size-5">
                     <li>Book a Reservation </li>

                     <li>Checking Loyalty Information & Point Balance (redirected customers to .com)</li>
                     <li>Update Account Information (redirected customers to .com)</li>

                  <p class="is-size-5">
                     Since the previous app redirected customers to the website for three of the five top uses,
                     it was important that we included all of these uses in the new mobile app. We also wanted the app
                     to address
                     the top questions asked by customers by adding new features:
                  </p>

                  <ul class="questions is-size-5">

                        <br> Include a section where members can easily locate their reservation number for upcoming
                        rentals.

                     <li> <i>What is my Gold Plus Rewards account number?</i>
                        <br> Provide a personalized experience that displays member name, number, status and point
                        balance in one view.
                     </li>
                     <li> <i> Where can I find my receipt?</i>
                        <br>Include a section where customers can find and view rental receipts for drop-off
                        confirmation.
                     </li>
                     <li> <i> Where can I update my credit card?</i>
                        <br>Include the ability for customers to modify their profile, and preferences on coverages and
                        payment options
                     </li>
                     <li> <i> Are there any nearby parking services? </i>
                        <br> Include Parking Service Integration with Spot Hero.
                     </li>
                     <li> <i> What is the address of my return location?</i>
                        <br>Provide location details including phone number, hours of operations, or address for
                        directions back to branch.
                     </li>
                     <li> <i> Can I change the time of my arrival?</i>
                        <br> Make it easy to view details of current reservation for return times or location
                        information.

                     The plan was to launch with these core features but to continue to iterate

                  As part of the content strategy we needed to appeal to these 3 different segments 
                  but also reduce unnecessary content and keep things simple and easy to digest. 
                  Including a fleet guide with high-res vehicle images would appeal to Car Enthusiasts. Promotions featuring 
                  vacation getaways and special offers would attract Deal Seekers.  Travel tips and Gold
                  Plus Rewards benefits would appeal to Quality Confidants in addition to offering essential

                  Since the previous app had been very limiting in terms of maintenance and updates-
                  all updates had to be done by developers- it was our goal to have the CMS host as much
                  content as possible, enabling our team to swap out imagery, text, or CTA’s as marketing
                  initiatives and priorities changed.

               <p class="is-size-5">
                  The design and layout was built by the IBM development team along with our
                  in-house UX and design teams but it was my job to create imagery templates
                  that could be used to ensure there was a consistent visual appearance and
                  brand reinforcement throughout the app.
               </p>
               <br>
               <p class="is-size-5">
                  It was important that the imagery and graphics displayed in the app shared similar
                  characteristics with the website and aligned with the new Brand Guidelines.
                  Hertz rebranded in 2017 and the new look was modernized with bright airy photogrophy and pops of
                  yellow.
               </p>
               <br>
               <p class="is-size-5">
                  While this color scheme was eye-catching and a great opportunity for brand
                  reinforcement, it made it tough to find imagery that had high enough contrast
                  to pass web accessibility standards when overlaid with text. We had to be very
                  careful we were adhering to color-blind standards.
               </p>

               <!-- <p class="is-size-5">
                     Overall we needed to solve two problems in the imagery designs:
                     </p>
                     <br>
                     <ul class="bullets is-size-5">
                     <li>Make the Text Readable</li>
                     <li>Minimize Dark Imagery </li>
                     </ul>
                     
                     <br>
                     <p class="is-size-5">
                     We came up with 3 different image treatments solutions to present to brand. 
                     </p>
                     <br>
                     <ol class="bullets is-size-5">
                     <li>Overlay entire image</li>
                     <li>Solid color block behind text</li>
                        <li>Scrim Overlay </li>
                     
                     </ol>
                     <br>
                     <p class="is-size-5">
                     In the end, the scrim overlay was chosen because it was a subtle enough design
                     change that didn’t affect the integrity of the image while also improving text readability.

                     For photography, three categories reflected the Hertz visual identity: Vehicle, 
                     Business and Leisure. I worked with creative services to 
                     create the imagery and templates in Adobe Indesign.

                  In the end, the third option was selected by the Brand team. The Mercedes and Corvette images were under special licenses with the OEMs so in the end it was deiceded it was better to show an image of a generic brand. The third option also incorporated
                  large amounts of yellow- a good opportunity for branding.

               In order to attract new loyalty members in the app, one of our 
               goals was to include fast track enrollment within the reservation flow.
               This made it easier for new renters to sign-up for our loyalty program
               as it created an account using their information entered in the reservation process. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="is-size-5">
               Content cards would also give us increased personalization and the opportunity 
               to target different segments (i.e. member vs non-member) with Adobe Target integration in the future.

               In order to improve revenue and encourage bookings on the mobile app we needed
               to make the rental process and log-in as easy as possible. For our customers convenience,

                  </h3>
            <p class="is-size-5">
               One of the top ways to improve the amount of revenue per rental was to increase ancillary
               sales (add-ons such as purchasing fuel ahead of time, better insurance coverage, etc). 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="is-size-5">
               Customer friendly messaging, premium photography & images of high-end fleet helped to provide an elevated and effortless booking process and appeal to the car enthusiast and quality confidant customer segments.

            <br>
            <p class="is-size-5">
               We wanted the new app to be helpful and convenient for our customers and add functionality that would address the top pain points customers had on the old app. It was important to add a section where customers could view & update profile information, view past rental history and find their receipts.
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>

               The last goal was to reduce the amount of app crashes and reduce load on developers by enabling our team to update the content.

            <br>
            <p class="is-size-5">
               Since the previous app had been very limiting in terms of maintenance and updates- all updates had to be done by developers- it was our goal to have the CMS host as much content as possible, enabling our team to swap out imagery, text, or CTA’s as marketing initiatives and priorities changed. We would become the go-to contacts for updates and maintenance on the app.

            <p class="is-size-5">
               We also wanted to make updates to style and imagery easier. To do this, developers coded the app so that
               most of the imagery pulled from the CMS, and could be swapped out as needed. We also found that adding
               gradient overlays directly on the images (vs hard coding these in the app) would make it easier for us to
               update the look and feel in case our visual rulebook changed. Though we may have lost some consistency
               and speed of updating these assets, it gave us more flexibility in the future.

                        Since launch, the mobile app team has continued to iterate and add new functionality. As a
                        content team, we were able to swap out marketing banners as new promotions arose, update special
                        offers in the deals section, and make updates to terms and conditions to communicate changes in
                        policies. The new app had a lot more flexibility and enabled marketing to make direct updates-
                        reducing time and expenses associated with developer involvement.

                        operating systems. I also got a sense of what goes into approvals and the best way to report
                        updates to leadership.
