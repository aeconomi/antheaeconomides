                           <p class="is-size-5">The old Hertz app was outdated, crashed frequently, and required
                              development in order to update content. In partnering with IBM, our team worked 
                              with the Marketing, UX, and Creative Services teams to deliver the new Hertz Mobile App.
                              The new Hertz app gives customers a faster rental experience, allowing users to quickly 
                              login with touch ID, manage their rewards, and find nearby locations  in an updated user
                              interface. My role was to help provide and maintain the content, and design templates 
                              that could be used to collaborate with brand and development teams. I also played a role
                              in marketing the launch of the app by building landing pages and posting banners and
                              videos on the website to help drive awareness.

                        One of the biggest problems customers had with the old app was that it either froze, 
                        crashed, or was slow to load. Because of this, giving our customers better speed
                        and convenience during their rental journey was a primary focus for the new app.

                        it was important that we included all of these uses in the new mobile app. We also wanted the app to help answer
                        some of the top questions asked by customers:

                        The plan was to launch with these core features but to continue to iterate

                     As part of the content strategy we needed to appeal to these 3 different segments

                     Including a fleet guide with high-res vehicle images would appeal to Car Enthusiasts. Promotions featuring 
                     vacation getaways and special offers would attract Deal Seekers.  Travel tips and Gold
                     Plus Rewards benefits would appeal to Quality Confidants in addition to offering essential

                        Since the previous app had been very limiting in terms of maintenance and updates- 
                        all updates had to be done by developers- it was our goal to have the CMS host as much
                         content as possible, enabling our team to swap out imagery, text, or CTA’s as marketing
                          initiatives and priorities changed.

                      <p class="is-size-5">
                        The design and layout was built by the IBM development team along with our
                         in-house UX and design teams but it was my job to create imagery templates 
                         that could be used to ensure there was a consistent visual appearance and 
                         brand reinforcement throughout the app.
                      </p>
                      <br>
                      <p class="is-size-5">
                        It was important that the imagery and graphics displayed in the app shared similar
                         characteristics with the website and aligned with the new Brand Guidelines.
                          Hertz rebranded in 2017 and the new look and feel was black and white with a 
                          pop of yellow to emphasize the Hertz yellow.
                      </p>
                      <p class="is-size-5">
                        While this color scheme was eye-catching and a great opportunity for brand
                         reinforcement, it made it tough to find imagery that had high enough contrast
                          to pass web accessibility standards when overlaid with text. We had to be very 
                          careful we were adhering to color-blind standards. We also needed to follow the
                           new brand guidelines which had changed from using dark photography with heavy black
                            accents to incorporating light and airy images with purposeful pops of yellow.
                      </p>
                      <br>
                      <p class="is-size-5">
                        Overall we needed to solve two problems in the imagery designs:
                      </p>
                      <br>
                      <p class="script">1. Make the Text Readable<br>
                        2. Minimize Dark Imagery 
                     </p>
                     <br>
                     <p class="is-size-5">
                        We came up with 3 different image treatments solutions to present to brand. 
                      </p>
                      <br>
                     <p class="script">1. Overlay entire image<br>
                        2. Solid color block behind text <br>
                        3. Scrim Overlay <br>
                     </p>
                     <br>
                     <p class="is-size-5">
                        In the end, the scrim overlay was chosen because it was a subtle enough design
                         change that didn’t affect the integrity of the image while also improving text readability.  
                      </p>
                      <br>
                      <p class="is-size-5">
                        For photography, three categories reflected the Hertz visual identity: Vehicle, 
                        Business and Leisure. For the image selections, multiple options were presented 
                        to the Brand team (iterations shown below). The selections were chosen based on those
                         that communicated an elevated and effortless travel experience, while also incorporating
                          large amounts of yellow- the biggest opportunity for branding. 
                      </p>
                      <br>
                      <p class="is-size-5">
                        To create the templates, I used a combination of Adobe XD and Indesign.

                        In order to make sure the images looked good on both Android and iOS, I created templates 
                        that could be used in our image export process. These ensured images were positioned and 
                        cropped in the right places on both operating systems.

                         This made it easier for new renters to sign-up for our loyalty program

                        The website was being migrated to page templates on a new version of AEM, which allowed for increased scalability
                        and contsistency throughout the site. While the first phase was focused on
                        migrating the Hertz website, the plan was to reutilize the code base and develop a list of 
                        features called a common core library that could be used for the Dollar and Thrifty website 
                        redesigns as well. This meant a lot of the generic content could be 
                        reused for all three brands, giving us a leg up on the transformations for the other Brands while reducing 
                        development costs.

                        We planned to roll out the website to different regions and dialects in an iterative fashion. 
                        With hertz.com serving customers in over 150 countries, each source market would have
                        content provided in English (US English or UK English) and many would have their region’s local 
                        dialect as well. In total, we had to plan and prep content to support 32 different dialects.

                        Working in iterative development cycles, we used A/B testing and user feedback to make
                        content updates and inform development as sections were released.  If design blockers to 
                        conversions were identified, we had processes in place that allowed us to pivot quickly to fix issues. In sessions using Clicktale, our analytics team found that one of the biggest 
                        pain-points for customers was site structure and search functionality. We ended up shortening
                        each menu title for simplicity and added search, chat, and contact information in the header 
                        to make it easier for customers to find what they were looking for.

                              The new reservation flow rolled out to US and Canadian customers in early March, 
                              right around when covid-19 shutdowns began. The virus took a direct hit on the travel 
                              industry so it was hard to measure the impact the redesign had on conversions and
                              eCommerce revenue. However, we were able to measure the impact on page load speed
                              right away. Page load times dropped from 6 seconds to 3-4 seconds- almost a 50% decrease!
                              Code refactoring played a role in this but also reducing file sizes and compressing images.

                              I learned so much from working on this project and all the logistics that go into a
                              website migration and redesign. It was interesting to be a part of each stage- to develop
                              and launch new features, conduct testing, then make changes based on our findings. 
                              Most often, the small differences had the biggest impact. Removing unnecessary steps
                              and popups from the checkout process was a primary driver in increased conversion rates.

                              One big learning was that creating consistent page templates and a single design system
                              is vital for a unified brand experience but it's also important to build templates and
                              components that allow for as much flexibility as possible as priorities and marketing 
                              initiatives change over time.

                              The project had many challenges, but one big difficulty stemmed from the sheer amount of
                              people  involved. People were constantly rolling on and off the project so it was tough 
                              keeping everyone on the same page. Another
                              difficulty was communicating with remote teams in different time zones. Slack made
                              back-and-forth updates more fluid but I also found recording meetings and training
                              sessions helpful. Our daily standups also kept team members aligned during each 
                              stage of the project and ensured there was no overlap in responsibilities.
