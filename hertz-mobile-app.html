                           <p class="is-size-5">The old Hertz app was outdated, crashed frequently, and required
                              development in order to update content. In partnering with IBM, our team worked 
                              with the Marketing, UX, and Creative Services teams to deliver the new Hertz Mobile App.
                              The new Hertz app gives customers a faster rental experience, allowing users to quickly 
                              login with touch ID, manage their rewards, and find nearby locations  in an updated user
                              interface. My role was to help provide and maintain the content, and design templates 
                              that could be used to collaborate with brand and development teams. I also played a role
                              in marketing the launch of the app by building landing pages and posting banners and
                              videos on the website to help drive awareness.

                         Giving our customers better speed
                        and convenience during their rental journey was a primary focus for the new app. One of the biggest problems customers had with the old app was that it either froze, 
                        crashed, or was slow to load.

                        Some of the top uses of the old Hertz app was to:

                        Since the previous app redirected customers to the website for three of the five top uses, 
                        it was important that we included all of these uses in the new mobile app. We also wanted the app to help answer
                        some of the top questions asked by customers:
                     </p>

                        The plan was to launch with these core features but to continue to iterate

                     As part of the content strategy we needed to appeal to these 3 different segments 
                     but also reduce unnecessary content and keep things simple and easy to digest. 
                     Including a fleet guide with high-res vehicle images would appeal to Car Enthusiasts. Promotions featuring 
                     vacation getaways and special offers would attract Deal Seekers.  Travel tips and Gold
                     Plus Rewards benefits would appeal to Quality Confidants in addition to offering essential

                        Since the previous app had been very limiting in terms of maintenance and updates- 
                        all updates had to be done by developers- it was our goal to have the CMS host as much
                        content as possible, enabling our team to swap out imagery, text, or CTA’s as marketing
                        initiatives and priorities changed.

                     <p class="is-size-5">
                        The design and layout was built by the IBM development team along with our
                        in-house UX and design teams but it was my job to create imagery templates 
                        that could be used to ensure there was a consistent visual appearance and 
                        brand reinforcement throughout the app.
                     </p>
                     <br>
                     <p class="is-size-5">
                        It was important that the imagery and graphics displayed in the app shared similar
                        characteristics with the website and aligned with the new Brand Guidelines.
                        Hertz rebranded in 2017 and the new look and feel was black and white with a 
                        pop of yellow.
                     </p>
                     <br>
                     <p class="is-size-5">
                        While this color scheme was eye-catching and a great opportunity for brand
                        reinforcement, it made it tough to find imagery that had high enough contrast
                        to pass web accessibility standards when overlaid with text. We had to be very 
                        careful we were adhering to color-blind standards. We also needed to follow the
                        new brand guidelines which had changed from using dark photography with heavy black
                        accents to incorporating light and airy images with purposeful pops of yellow.
                     </p>
                     <br>
                     <p class="is-size-5">
                        Overall we needed to solve two problems in the imagery designs:
                     </p>
                     <br>
                     <p class="script">1. Make the Text Readable<br>
                        2. Minimize Dark Imagery 
                     </p>
                     <br>
                     <p class="is-size-5">
                        We came up with 3 different image treatments solutions to present to brand. 
                     </p>
                     <br>
                     <p class="script">1. Overlay entire image<br>
                        2. Solid color block behind text <br>
                        3. Scrim Overlay <br>
                     </p>
                     <br>
                     <p class="is-size-5">
                        In the end, the scrim overlay was chosen because it was a subtle enough design
                        change that didn’t affect the integrity of the image while also improving text readability.  
                     </p>
                     <br>
                     <p class="is-size-5">
                        For photography, three categories reflected the Hertz visual identity: Vehicle, 
                        Business and Leisure. For the image selections, multiple options were presented 
                        to the Brand team (iterations shown below). The selections were chosen based on those
                        that communicated an elevated and effortless travel experience.

                        In order to attract new loyalty members in the app, one of our 
                        goals was to include fast track enrollment within the reservation flow.
                        This made it easier for new renters to sign-up for our loyalty program
                        as it created an account using their information entered in the reservation process.

                     One of the top ways to improve the amount of revenue per rental was to increase ancillary

                        We wanted the new app to be helpful and convenient for our customers and add functionality that would address the top pain points customers had on the old app. It was important to add a section where customers could view & update profile information, view past rental history and find their receipts.

                        Since the previous app had been very limiting in terms of maintenance and updates- all updates had to be done by developers- it was our goal to have the CMS host as much content as possible, enabling our team to swap out imagery, text, or CTA’s as marketing initiatives and priorities changed. We would become the go-to contacts for updates and maintenance on the app.

                        We also wanted to make updates to style and imagery easier. To do this, developers coded the app so that most of the imagery pulled from the CMS, and could be swapped out as needed. We also found that adding gradient overlays directly on the images (vs hard coding these in the app) would make it easier for us to update the look and feel in case our visual rulebook changed. Though we may have lost some consistency and speed of updating these assets, it gave us more flexibility in the future.

                            The new Hertz Mobile App achieved a 4.8 out 5 star rating on the App Store, compared to the previous 3.8 stars on the old app. The redesign also led to a 32% increase in monthly mobile app users and a 50% increase in sessions YOY.

                            Since launch, the mobile app team has continued to iterate and add new functionality. As a content team, we were able to swap out marketing banners as new promotions arose, update special offers in the deals section, and make updates to terms and conditions to communicate changes in policies. The new app had a lot more flexibility and enabled marketing to make direct updates- reducing time and expenses associated with developer involvement.

I also got a sense of what goes into approvals and the best  way to report updates to leadership.
